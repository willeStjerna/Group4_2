# Team
We as group asses we are in the “Performing” state of way-of-working. We all have a clear understanding of who we are, what skills the team possess, and how we communicate. This became established already in assignment 1. We have understood our equal responsibilities in contributing roughly equal amount because we are using a flat structure without an official leader. We communicate openly on discord for team-cohesion and uses GitHub issues/comments for more technical issues. Trust has been established by seeing the effort each person has made in assignment 1 and 2. This has been further reinforced when people have shown to own up and correct mistakes (such as reverting commits made directly to main). Even though it's hard to tell this early on, the team seems to fulfill all the checkboxes in “Performing” as well where we are adapting and trying to minimize wasted work. 

## Next steps
Improvements can of course be made in most areas, but particularly by implementing a more structured way of dividing up the work. This would hopefully make the responsibilities more clear, make members more efficient by specializing in certain areas, and prevent waste by multiple people working on the same problems. Another improvement could be the pull-request/approve merge process, as it has been slowing down the act of quick-fixes. One way of doing this is allowing self-approval if it's for fixing small bugs that hinders execution.
