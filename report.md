# Way of Working

After this additional period of work, we as a group assess that we are in the **“In Place”** state of way-of-working. After iterating on our way of working from the previous assignment, we established a much clearer set of guideline for our workflow. This has allowed us all to work more in unison as a team, allowing us to focus on indivivual work while trusting that our team members know their tasks and how to do them.

The context of the work has remained unchanged, where we work **asynchronously** using **Git** and **Discord** as our main communication channels. Our team members have different availability, so we continue to coordinate our work accordingly.

Since the last assignment, we have established principles additional such as:
- **Name convention for issues and pull requests** with clear tags and header structure.
- **Using pull requests and branches correctly** and always linking pull requests to the appropriate issue.
- **Established a more consistent practice** where we all follow the same workflow of assigning issues, committing, reviewing and merging.
- **Correctly use commit descriptions** to document the changes and link to issues.
- **Agreed on a code structure** which we all follow, such as function naming and commenting, to ensure consistant code readability.

## Next Steps

To reach the next stage, we need to:
1. **Continuing to iterate on our Git-oriented template**    
   - Define clearer practice for reviewing and closing issues, to make each members individual role more clear in terms of closing issues and merging.

2. **Hold more regular meetings**  
   - Be more consistant at setting specific meeting times in advance instead of discussing potential meetings.
